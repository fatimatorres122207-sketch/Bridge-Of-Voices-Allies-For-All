Being first-generation means stepping into every space with dual responsibility — 
honoring where I came from while simultaneously building something that has never existed before me. 
I moved to the United States from Mexico at six years old, long before I understood the weight of that transition.
As a Mexican first-generation woman, I grew up learning to navigate systems, expectations, and opportunities without a roadmap. 
There was no older sibling to ask, no parent who had gone through college here, no example to copy. Every choice felt like I was carving the path from scratch 
— academically, socially, financially, and professionally.

It is not easy being first-generation. I faced challenges while also helping my parents navigate this country. 
I began translating for my family at a young age — in hospitals, at parent-teacher conferences, and even attempting to interpret legal documents.
Those experiences force you to grow up fast. I always felt older than my age, and in many ways, I lost parts of my childhood to responsibility.

When I went to college, I felt out of place. I didn’t have the privilege of parents who could guide me or an older sibling who had done it first. 
It was me. I had to learn everything the hard way. I was the first daughter, granddaughter, and cousin to go to college. Through trial and error, I figured it out
— and I graduated.

I made sure to pass down everything I learned to my younger cousins so they wouldn’t struggle the way I did. Seeing their transition into college become easier
because of my guidance made every struggle worth it.

These experiences shaped the woman I am today.
